[ CVE ]
 - A CVE is a unique identifier assigned to a specific publicly known cybersecurity vulnerability in software or hardware.

 - CVE IDs make it easier to:
    + Track vulnerabilities across different tools and vendors.
    + Share consistent information among security researchers, software vendors, and users.

 - Format: CVE-[year]-[number]

 - CVE is maintained by MITRE Corporation and is used by organizations like:
    + NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) through the NVD
    + Security vendors (e.g., Qualys, Tenable, Rapid7)
    + Linux distributions, GitHub, etc.
	

[ CWE ]
 - A CWE is a category or type of software weakness that can lead to a vulnerability. Think of it as the root cause or coding flaw â€” a CVE is an instance of a weakness, and a CWE is the general class of that weakness.

 - CWE allows you to:
    + Understand why a vulnerability happens.
    + Categorize bugs across different software projects.
    + Improve secure coding practices.

Example:
|            CVE             |                 CWE                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| CVE-2013-4237              | CWE-121 (Stack-based buffer overflow) |
| CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) | CWE-94 (Code Injection)               |
