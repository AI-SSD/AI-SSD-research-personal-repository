Quick resume: security flaw in the GNU C Library (glibc) related to DNS name resolution.

Component affected: glibc, specifically the getaddrinfo() function in nss_dns/dns-host.c
	
Vulnerability type: Memory corruption / Denial of Service / Possibly code execution

Versions affected: glibc before 2.18

Cause: Failure to properly handle embedded null (\0) bytes in domain names when resolving them via DNS.

Details:
    - The getaddrinfo() function is used for DNS resolution.
    - An attacker could craft a domain name with an embedded null byte (e.g., "example.com\0.bad.com").
    - glibc would interpret this as "example.com" (due to the null terminator in C strings), but DNS queries would go out to "example.com\0.bad.com" â€” causing mismatches and potentially:
        + Out-of-bounds memory access
        + Application crash (Denial of Service)
        + Possibly arbitrary code execution, depending on how the memory is handled
